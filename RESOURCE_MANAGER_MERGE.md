# Resource Manager Merge Summary

## Overview
Successfully merged the enhanced resource manager functionality into the existing resource manager, creating a unified, comprehensive resource management system for VidTanium.

## Key Enhancements Added

### 1. Enhanced Resource States
- Added `ResourceState` enum with lifecycle states: CREATED, ACTIVE, IDLE, CLEANUP_PENDING, CLEANED, LEAKED
- Resources now track their complete lifecycle with state transitions

### 2. Advanced Metrics Tracking
- `ResourceMetrics` class tracks detailed usage statistics:
  - Creation time and last access time
  - Access count and memory usage
  - Cleanup attempts and state change history
  - Age and idle time calculations

### 3. Leak Detection System
- `LeakDetector` class with configurable thresholds
- Automatic detection of potential resource leaks based on:
  - Resource age (default: 1 hour)
  - Idle time (default: 30 minutes)
  - Memory usage (default: 100MB)
  - Access patterns

### 4. Dependency Management
- Resources can now have dependencies and dependents
- Prevents cleanup of resources that have active dependents
- Automatic cleanup of dependency relationships

### 5. Enhanced Statistics
- Comprehensive statistics including:
  - Total resources by state (active, idle, leaked)
  - Memory usage tracking
  - Cleanup success/failure rates
  - Leak detection reports

### 6. Improved Cleanup Logic
- Enhanced cleanup with dependency checking
- Force cleanup option for emergency situations
- Automatic leak cleanup during monitoring cycles
- Better error handling and retry logic

## Backward Compatibility

The merge maintains full backward compatibility with the existing API:
- All original methods remain unchanged
- Original `ResourceInfo` class enhanced with new features
- Existing cleanup rules and behavior preserved
- Added new methods with `_enhanced` suffix where needed

## New Methods Added

### Core Methods
- `cleanup_resource_enhanced()` - Enhanced cleanup with dependency checking
- `get_enhanced_stats()` - Comprehensive statistics
- `start_monitoring()` / `stop_monitoring()` - Aliases for enhanced monitoring
- `cleanup_all_resources()` - Clean up all resources with force option

### Internal Methods
- `_estimate_memory_usage()` - Memory usage estimation
- `_mark_as_leaked()` - Mark resources as leaked
- `_check_for_leaks()` - Periodic leak detection

## Configuration Enhancements

### New Resource Types
- Added support for FILE, MEMORY, DATABASE resource types
- Enhanced NETWORK resource type handling

### Monitoring Configuration
- Configurable leak detection thresholds
- Adjustable monitoring intervals
- Memory pressure monitoring

## Integration Points

The merged resource manager integrates seamlessly with:
- Connection pool manager
- Memory optimizer
- Adaptive timeout manager
- Circuit breaker manager
- Progressive recovery manager

## Usage Examples

```python
# Register resource with dependencies
resource_id = resource_manager.register_resource(
    resource=my_resource,
    resource_type=ResourceType.DOWNLOAD_TASK,
    dependencies={"parent_task_id"},
    metadata={"priority": "high"}
)

# Enhanced cleanup with dependency checking
success = resource_manager.cleanup_resource_enhanced(resource_id, force=False)

# Get comprehensive statistics
stats = resource_manager.get_enhanced_stats()
print(f"Active resources: {stats['active_resources']}")
print(f"Memory usage: {stats['total_memory_mb']:.2f} MB")
print(f"Leaked resources: {stats['leaked_resources']}")
```

## Benefits

1. **Unified Management**: Single point of control for all resource lifecycle management
2. **Leak Prevention**: Proactive detection and cleanup of resource leaks
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed metrics for optimization
4. **Dependency Safety**: Prevents premature cleanup of dependent resources
5. **Memory Efficiency**: Tracks and optimizes memory usage
6. **Debugging Support**: Enhanced logging and statistics for troubleshooting

## Files Modified

- `src/core/resource_manager.py` - Enhanced with new functionality
- `src/core/downloader.py` - Updated to use merged resource manager
- `src/core/enhanced_resource_manager.py` - Removed (merged into resource_manager.py)

The merge successfully combines the best features of both resource managers while maintaining compatibility and adding powerful new capabilities for robust resource management in VidTanium.
